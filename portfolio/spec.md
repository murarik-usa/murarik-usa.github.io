# Portfolio

## Overview
A high-end portfolio website for a pre-med biology student, designed as a medical "patient report" with glassmorphic design elements and smooth animations.

## Design Requirements
- Light theme inspired by Apple Health dashboards and biotech interfaces with green color palette
- Glassmorphic design with frosted glass panels, soft blur effects, and subtle gradients
- Color palette: soft jade, mint, sage green, and white tones with varying green hues for accents
- Minimalist typography with strong visual hierarchy
- All section headers are center-aligned across the site with minimalist and modern styling - clean typography, no decorative flourishes or hover effects
- Enhanced smooth, modern transition effects throughout the site including gentle fade-ins, slides, and opacity/blur transitions
- Visible, smooth fade-in and parallax-like motion effects across all major sections for dynamic browsing experience
- Transitions activate on scroll interactions, maintaining clinical glassmorphic green aesthetic
- Cinematic feel with enhanced readability through subtle, non-flashy animations
- Micro-interactions including pulse animations in green tones (excluding Home and Diagnostics sections)
- Enlarged icons across all sections for improved visibility and balance
- All section accents, borders, gradients, and interactive elements use harmonizing green hues
- Maintain balanced contrast and readability with the new green color scheme
- Fully responsive design optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts while preserving glassmorphic styling and smooth animations
- No hover effects on any elements except buttons - all visual interactivity on sections, text, cards, images, and icons is disabled
- Button hover effects maintain subtle and consistent styling aligned with the minimalist green aesthetic

## Navigation
- Sticky glassmorphic navigation bar at the top of the site with no animated effects
- Remains visible during scrolling with soft transparency and subtle blur effect
- Section links: Home, Current Coursework, Clinical History, Research Findings, Diagnostics, Leadership Experience, Treatment Plan, Gallery, Contact
- Simple minimalist underline style for active or hovered links with no other effects
- Seamlessly blends with the glassmorphic page design
